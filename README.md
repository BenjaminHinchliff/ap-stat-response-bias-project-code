# Ap Statistics Response Bias Project Code

I decided to have some fun and write a bunch of code to do all my work for me and get an excuse to learn Go in the process. So this is the source code for that.

details on what each module does in the module's README.md file.

A few things:
- I tried on code quality, but Go is weird and I'm inexperienced with it so no guarantees.
- I'm just using Rust next time.
- All output files have been removed for privacy reasons
